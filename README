NAME
    RT::Extension::ResetPassword - add "forgot your password?" link to RT
    instance

DESCRIPTION
    This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the
    front of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a
    password reset token by email. RT will send the user a one-time URL
    which he or she can use to reset her password. This extension allows
    only users that already have passwords reset their passwords by email.
    There isn't yet an option to only allow privileged or unpriviliged users
    to reset their passwords.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"

        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.
